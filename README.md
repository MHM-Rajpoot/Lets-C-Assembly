# Let's C Assembly

Welcome to **Let's C Assembly**! This project is designed to help you understand the intricacies of assembly language programming by breaking down C code into its assembly equivalent. The repository is structured to guide you through the basics of computer system design to more advanced topics like stack context switching and recursion. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of how high-level C code translates into low-level assembly instructions.
